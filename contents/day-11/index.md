# Day 11: Finish User Likes

## Setting up

We'll begin developing on the Day 11 branch of the geekbook repository. If
you were able to follow along through the last class, you can continue along
with your own repo.

Or, you can clone my repo and checkout the branch:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:dphaener/geekbook.git
$ cd geekbook
$ git checkout day-11
```

If you have already cloned my repo, just fetch all the changes and then
checkout the branch:

```bash
$ cd geekbook
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout -t origin/day-11
```

## How should we finish up?

*Discuss:* How should we finish the class up? Websockets or Relay

Let's do it!
