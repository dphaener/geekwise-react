# Final Project

Your final project for this class will be....... to create a Todo List! But
not just any todo list. This todo list will be backed by a database, and you
should be able to have multiple lists.

Requirements:

  * Ability to create an account and login
  * Must be able to create and manage multiple todo lists

That's pretty much it for the basic requirements!

Too easy? Add the ability to share lists with other users!

Still too easy? Create your own backend!

Still too easy? Use [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) to manage your data!


## Coming Soon

Database backend url and schema specification.
